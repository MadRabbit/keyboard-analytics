# Type RTC

Playing with WebRTC in order to try to understand and measure hands movements
over a keyboard better by collecting real life data.

## The Outcomes

As the result of this experiment I managed to calculate the following map of
hand movements (in distances normalized to a key cap size):

```
17 14 08 08 13 16 23 19 09 08 07 15 17
   06 02 01 06 11 14 09 01 01 07 09 13 18
   00 00 00 00 07 07 00 00 00 00 05 11
     07 08 10 06 10 04 02 05 05 03
05               00                 11
```

## Usage

Generally `npm start` but you will need magic trackers on your hands a bottle
of wine and some gentle german electronics in your headphones.
