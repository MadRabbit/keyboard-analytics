# Type RTC

Playing with WebRTC in order to try to understand and measure hands movements
over a keyboard better by collecting real life data.

## The Outcomes

As the result of this experiment I managed to calculate the following map of
hand movements (in distances normalized to a key cap size):

```
17 14 08 08 14 17 28 24 12 10 17 16 19
   06 02 03 07 12 17 10 05 03 07 08 10 18
   02 01 01 02 08 07 02 01 01 01 05 11
     06 09 11 09 11 03 02 05 06 04
05               00                    15
```

## Usage

Generally `npm start` but you will need magic trackers on your hands a bottle
of wine and some gentle german electronics in your headphones.
